# Running Codes and Rapid Response Teams 
======
### University of Utah, Internal Medicine Residents

### Methods: 
We discussed with stakeholders / participants in codes and rapid response teams to identify the most common and consequential mistakes residents make: 
- It’s not clear who is running the code.
- A shockable rhythm is not shocked.
- Decisions are too delayed.
- The person who activated the response gets snarked for a false alarm.

(please contact us if you know of other events or near-misses)

### The learning objectives:
- Discuss micro-skills/schemas to avoid each error.   

## Module 1: Leadership

## Summary

- “I’m <Name>, the resident on the code team. Who is running this code?” ”Can I take over?”
- Stand at the foot of the bed. Don’t move and don’t do tasks. 
- Set the tone; give encouragement to sharing information/suggestions
- Keep the big picture in mind:
-- RRT: Is this a code? Does this patient need to go to the ICU?
-- Code: High quality compressions; shock if shockable
