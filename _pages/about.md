I am a board-certified researcher, pulmonologist, and intensivist associated with Intermountain Health and the University of Utah. I'm interested in pragmatic clinical research, particularly of hypercapnic respiratory failure. My training has focused on computer science (University of Colorado BS 2009), medicine (University of Colorado, MD 2016), medical education (Internal Medicine Chief Medical Resident at [University of Utah Affiliated Hospitals and Clinics](https://medicine.utah.edu/internalmedicine/residency/) 2019-2020), and clinical investigation (MS in Clinical Investigation, University of Utah 2023).
