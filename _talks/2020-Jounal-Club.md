An educational innovation to adapt the Journal Club format to modern frameworks of evidence-based medicine (EBM). Specifically, instead of discussing an individual article with unstructured commentary weekly we made 4 modifications to enhance the utility toward teaching EBM: 1. An article, guideline, and clinical scenario are chosen, 2. critical appraisal templates were used, 3. facilitator guides were created to help educate facilitators and 4. topics were repeated for successive cohorts of residents to allow sufficient preparation.
