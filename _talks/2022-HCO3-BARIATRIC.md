###The ERS proposed spectrum of hypoventilatory disorders:

###Evidence supporting isolated elevated daytime bicarbonate (without frank hypercapnia) as intermediary stage toward hypoventilation.

###Most recent ATS OHS Diagnosis Management guideline suggesting 25-30% body weight loss, which usually requires surgery, and also systematically reviews evidence around test characteristics of 27 mEq/L as a cutoff for OHS screening.

###Cleveland Clinic Bariatric Surgery Cohort with an estimated prevalence of OHS (Stage 2 and Above) of 68.4% (though EtCO2 over 45 mmHg was also included)

###Estimate of the prevalence of each ERS stage of obesity-related hypoventilation among obese patients (BMI 40 kg/m^2 or higher): Stage 0 (no hypoventilation) 61%; Stage 1 or 2 (nocturnal hypoventilation) 19%; Stage 3 or 4 (daytime hypoventilation) 17%.

##Support for exclusions:

###Review articles on kidney factors influencing the development of metabolic acidosis: GFR < 40 ml/min/1.73m^2 is when risk of acidosis begins to increase, but below 60 ml/min/1.73m^2 (~sCr 1.3 by CKD-EPI) is likely when acid-base handling begins to decrease. Additionally, medications influencing the RAAS system (e.g. spironolactone) influence metabolic acid-base.
